CSS Eliminator

Minimizes an HTML and CSS file combination to a smaller CSS file containing 
only rules used by the provided HTML.

For best results, copy "Generated HTML" using Firefox's Web Developer 
Toolbar instead of a simple "View Source".

This works well with minimized CSS as input but it doesn't minimize or
mangle the output CSS except to eliminate un-needed CSS rules.

Usage: ruby css_eliminator.rb 
          <input_html_file> <input_css_file> <output_minimized_css_file>
        Input streams can be a resource, e.g. http://
        
Run test.rb for an example.
